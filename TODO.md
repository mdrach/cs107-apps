# Future ideas

## Deploying
- Note that [you may need to configure your production server to support client-side routing](#serving-apps-with-client-side-routing) before deploying your app.

## bit_operations
- allow for ~ and << >> both arithmetic and logical, more bit operations
- allow for inputs like UINT_MAX and 0UL to teach about these (can allow in hex field)

## floating_point
- color code mantissa, exp, sign in all 3 parts
- make separate interactive updating equation (that syncs with bytes)
- description (like scientific notation)
- Allow adding decimal to far left and right of interactive view
- Anything else in existing floating point app linked to on cs107 website

# Additional apps
- base converter binary <-> hex <-> decimal w/ limits.h
- void * (show how casting changes things)
