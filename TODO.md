# Things that may need to be done in the future
- Note that [you may need to configure your production server to support client-side routing](#serving-apps-with-client-side-routing) before deploying your app.
- Where should "helper functions" go?  within class, within class static, above class same file, different file.

## bit_operations
- allow for ~ and << >> both arithmetic and logical, more bit operations
- allow for inputs like UINT_MAX and 0UL to teach about these (can allow in hex field)

## floating_point
- color code mantissa, exp, sign in all 3 parts
- make separate interactive updating equation (that syncs with bytes)
- description (like scientific notation)
- Allow adding decimal to far left and right of interactive view
- Anything else in existing floating point app linked to on cs107 website


# Conceptual things to look up later
- Why does `export default name1` in ./file get imported fine in ./anotherfile with `import name2 from ./file`
- What to use instead of namespaces in React, for example xvg xlink:href="#theId"
